                <li><strong>Electronic Disposal: </strong>Electronic documents are deleted using secure wiping software that overwrites the data multiple times, making it unrecoverable. This process ensures that deleted documents cannot be accessed or restored by any means.  
                </li>

                <li><strong>Verification: </strong>The shredding and disposal processes are verified and logged by authorized personnel to ensure compliance with our document destruction policy.
